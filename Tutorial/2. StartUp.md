<h1>Step 1</h1><br>

<p>Now that we have everything installed, open the index.js file and lets get to work!</p>
</p>Before we even start thinking about turning the bot on, we first must import the packages we installed! To do this, we must type the following:</p>

---
**Code**

    const { CommandoClient } = require("discord.js-commando");
    const discord = require("discord.js");
    const path = require("path");

---

<p>Now we must define the new client. To do this, we must type the following:</p>

---
**Code**

    const bot = new CommandoClient();

---

<p>Finally, we must log into the bot to turn it on! To do this, we must do the following:</p>

---
**Code**

    bot.login("bot-token-here");

---

<p>If you have done all of this, your index.js file should look like this:</p>

---
**Index.js**

    const { CommandoClient } = require("discord.js-commando");
    const discord = require("discord.js");
    const path = require("path");

    const bot = new CommandoClient();

    bot.login("bot-token-here");

---

<p>Now that everything is put together, hold ctrl then press s to save the file! Now open up the console and type, node .</p>

> **_NOTE:_**  To stop the bot, go back to console and hold ctrl then press c

<h1>Other stuff</h1>
<p>I'm sure you noticed that it can take a minute to load the bot. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to tell when the bot turns on?</p>
<p>Go back into the index.js file and add the following code under the bot.login and put the following:</p>

---
**Startup Listener**

    bot.on('ready', function(){
        console.log("Ready!");
    });

---

<p>Doing this will have a listener alert you when the bot turns on. In this case, we will have the bot message console saying "Ready!" when the bot is active.</p>
<p>Another adjustment we can make to the code is changing the prefix. This case, we want to go to the client and do the following changes!</p>

---
**Changing Bot Prefix**

    const bot = new CommandoClient({
	    commandPrefix: "-",
    });

---

<p>Assuming you did the following changes, the code should now look something among the line of this:</p>

---
**Index.js**

    const { CommandoClient } = require("discord.js-commando");
    const discord = require("discord.js");
    const path = require("path");

    const bot = new CommandoClient({
        commandPrefix: "-",
    });

    bot.login("bot-token-here");

    bot.on('ready', function(){
        console.log("Ready!");
    });

---

<p>Assuming you did all the changes correctly, your code should look like ours as shown above. You should be able to go to the console and turn the bot on!<br>
    1. You have now changes the bots default prefix of ! to - <br>
    2. You have made a start listener for the bot <br>

    Congradulations! You have finished part two of making a Discord bot!
